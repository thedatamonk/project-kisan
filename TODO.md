1. ~~Explore the response of the API and figure out what kind of questions can the agent answer~~
2. Build the agent orchestrator to handle the 3 functions
3. Handle multi-turn conversations
4. Chain tools together - I think this will be automatically handled if we include our planning agent mechanism
5. Use a proper vector database instead of in-memory
6. Use real government schema data - scrape from official websites, use PDFS etc instead of mock data
